SignOs is an iOS app that signs, installs and updates other apps on your device, the same
way the App Store does it. Tap Get on any app from a repository and that's it — it
downloads in the background, signs itself, installs, and shows up on your home screen.

It's built on top of the open source [Feather](https://github.com/claration/Feather) project.
SignOs is owned and developed by me, @ihateios — huge thanks to clARATION and the Feather
contributors for their work, this wouldn't exist without them.

## Features

## Install

Download `SignOs.ipa` from [Releases](../../releases/latest) and sign it with SideStore,
Sideloadly, AltStore, TrollStore or SignOs itself. Every push to main builds a fresh IPA
automatically, and tagging a version publishes a release. The app can also update itself
from its own repository right on your device.

## Building

```
make iphoneos
```

That produces packages/SignOs.ipa. You need Xcode 26 or newer on macOS.
